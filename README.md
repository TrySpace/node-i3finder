#I3 Finder

Script for finding windows/workspaces/marks in the I3 Tiliing window manager.

I3 finder is used to focus or move i3 windows and workspaces.
Simliar to quickswitch.py, however list of choices to select includes 
marks, workspaces, and windows all together (rather then requiring different paramters for each).
